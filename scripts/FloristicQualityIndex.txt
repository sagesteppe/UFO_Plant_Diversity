considering calculating the Floristic quality index from the species richness could be interesting and make good inroads with CNHP and others in the state. It seems somewhat easy to do, and maybe it would behoove me to make an R package for it, the calulcations look pretty trivial, the problem is accessing the state lists. https://cnhp.colostate.edu/download/documents/2020/CO_FQA_2020_Final_Report.pdf https://cnhp.colostate.edu/download/documents/cwic_docs/FQA_calculations.pdf r package here : https://github.com/equitable-equations/fqar
